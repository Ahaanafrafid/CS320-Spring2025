In this assignment, we enhanced the MyCookBook application by implementing a search functionality that allows users to filter recipes by name. This involved both backend and frontend development to provide a seamless experience.

Key Accomplishments:
Backend Enhancements:

Designed a new API endpoint (HttpGet or HttpPost) in the service layer to handle search queries.
Implemented filtering logic using a static list of recipes to simulate a database.
Tested the API with Postman to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Frontend Integration:

Added a search bar to the Index.cshtml view, enabling users to input their queries.
Displayed filtered recipes dynamically, ensuring real-time feedback for the search functionality.
Retained existing recipe display logic while integrating the new feature.
Collaboration Between Layers:

Connected the UI to the API via a service method that processed search requests and returned results.
Ensured consistent data flow from the API to the frontend, reflecting changes instantly.
