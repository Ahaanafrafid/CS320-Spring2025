This assignment was an excellent exercise in understanding and implementing a full-stack application using ASP.NET Core. By developing both the service and application layers, you gained insights into:

Architectural Design: Learning how to structure an application using the MVC pattern and understanding the separation of concerns between the service layer (backend logic) and the application layer (frontend and user interactions).
Practical Development Skills: You enhanced your ability to write both backend and frontend code, manage dependencies, and debug complex issues across the stack.
Integration and Testing: The project required you to ensure that all parts of your application worked together seamlessly, from database interactions in the backend to AJAX calls in the frontend.
Problem-Solving: The various challenges we addressed—from setting up the development environment to debugging runtime errors—helped hone your problem-solving skills in a real-world application context.
